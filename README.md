# Fractal-Generator

Note: I have written a better version of this program which is also on my Github.

Program I started to write on a car ride summer of 2013.  It generates colored pictures of Mandelbrot and Julia sets.
The sets are generated based off of recursive mathematical functions that take complex numbers as parameters. The color of a point is absed on how many iterations of the functions it took for a point to diverge, and the black points are points that did not diverge after the number of iterations checked.  For example, the number of iterations checked may be 256, so then the points that do not diverge after 256 iterations will be colored black. 
This program was written a long time ago, and I was still familiarisinzg my self with the swing library, so the code is messy.

The relation that defines the Mandlebrot set is Un = (Un-1)^2 + U0.  For any complex number z, U0 is set to z and z is in the mandlebrot set if and only if the magnitude of the relation is bounded as n appraoches infinity.  It is proven that it will diverge if the magnitude of any iteration is greater than 4, so the color is based on the number of iterations it takes for the set to exceed 4.  Since some points require an arbitrarily large number of iterations before having a magnitude greater than 4, the program checks a fininte number of iterations, and assumes all points that do not diverge after that many iterations will never diverge.  This results in the program overestimating the size of the set (by a very small amount).  Increasing the number of iterations will "carve" details into the curve, but it will also increase the computing time require to find them.  Julia sets are generated by the same function, but instead of setting z to U0, U0 is set to the same number for all z.  This means there are an infinite number of Julia sets.
